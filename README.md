# REST API for D3 Leaderboards
This web application retrieves data through Blizzard's API and saves it into a database. 
Leaderboards are periodically updated (Celery tasks).

See the app in action at [my github page](https://korpog.github.io/)

Source code for the frontend is [here](https://github.com/korpog/d3lb-front)
